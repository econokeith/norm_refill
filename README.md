Simple Application of Expectations Maximization and Bayes' Rule to Fill in Missing Financial Data

Includes a notebook and .py file that demostrates a single function I use to refill missing financial data in Quandl time-series.
It assumes the missing data is a random variable and calculates the sufficient statistics of the dataset at the 
same time as MAP estimates of the missing data.

See the .ipynb for details on its use.
